     * Selection sort- find smallest element in unsorted region and swap it with the element at the front of unsorted region. 
     * 
     * Analyzing performance
     * for an array of size n how many elements visited to complete the sort?
     * Big Oh notation
     * only care about the growth rate, selection sort is O (n^2) quadratic
     * 
     * Insertion Sort - Insert first element in unsorted region into proper location in sorted region by shifting all larger sorted elements to a greater index O(n^2)
     * 
     * 
     * Merge Sort - split array in half, recursively sort each half, merge the sorted halves. O (n log(n))
